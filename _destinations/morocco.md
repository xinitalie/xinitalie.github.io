My trip to Morocco came right after my trip to Israel, and after having such a great experience there, I thought that there was no way anything could top that. Well Morocco, you came real close.

While in Morocco, we stayed in some amazing places. We started off in Marrakesh at the Riad Andalla Spa. From the outside, the riad was underwhelming. There were rusted gates leading to an old alley, but the second I stepped inside I saw this riad's true beauty. Classic Moroccan mosaics, intricate plaster designs, and a pool in the middle of the lobby.
