My trip to Morocco came right after my trip to Israel, and after having such a great experience there, I thought that there was no way anything could top that. Well Morocco, you came real close.

I arrived to the airport in Morocco early, the morning after I departed Israel. It was clean and bright, and I was optimistic. Unfortunately, I had not yet gotten a SIM card and did not know everything that I needed to about my accommodation to get past immigration. So my trip was not starting out on the right foot.
