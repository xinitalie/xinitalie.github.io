	<p>Hi, I'm Xin. I am a 19 year old from New York City. I am currently at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, getting a degree in Management and Sustainable Development and finishing up my second year. I have done photography in many environments, from working as a production assistant at New York Fashion Week to volunteering in an animal shelter in St Croix.

I love any kind of travel and am always up for new adventures and new foods. Please contact me if you'd ever like to join me on my travels! </p>
