	<p>The human condition is a term referring to the characteristics, events, situations that encompass the whole of human existence. This includes birth, growth, emotions, conflicts, desire, and morality. Throughout three novels, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Ubik, and We Can Remember It For You Wholesale, author Philip K Dick examines technology’s role as a catalyst for the decomposition of the human condition and its negative influence on bureaucratic companies in a middle class, postmodern society. Each novel’s futuristic setting includes at least one kind of technology that yields to some cataclysmic disaster and the eventual degradation of humanity. </p>
