	<p>Hi, I'm Xin. I am a 20 year old from New York City. I am currently a third year student at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, working towards an M.A. in Management and Sustainable Development. I have done photography in many environments, from working as a production assistant at New York Fashion Week to volunteering in an animal shelter in St Croix. I love any kind of travel and am always up for new adventures. </p>
