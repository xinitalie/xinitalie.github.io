			<p>My trip to Morocco came right after my trip to Israel, and after having such a great experience there, I thought that there was no way anything could top that. Well Morocco, you came real close.</p>

			<p>30 December 2018. The day I met a group of people that would soon become my closest friends. Over the course of 10 days, we saw more of Israel than I thought was possible. We started in Jerusalem, where we got to celebrate the ringing in of the new year, and left each other in Tel Aviv, where we spent the morning in Sarona Market, coming to terms with saying goodbye.</p>
